CAMP - Computer Aided Music Production
======================================

CAMP is a music composition system.

Goals are to provide:

   * a pythonic and intuitive music theory library, enabling "music as code"
   * tools that enable composition at faster speeds, inspired by trackers & nashville notation, but mixing in higher level constructs
   * a library suitable as a basis for theory-backed algorithmic composition programs
   * pluggable output modes so we're not dependent on some library continuing to work, but enable both realtime MIDI, MIDI output, and notation
   * endless-composition genre-shifting features suitable for never ending songs that also remain interesting

License
