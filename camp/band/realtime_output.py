    Somewhat of a misnomer, the realtime output doesn't really output anything.
    However, it does throw away events that aren't musically relevant, and records
    whether the performance is done or not by way of the special 'got_events' flag.

    The actual processing of the realtime timeline and actual realtime work is mainly
    in the conductor class.  This then, could technically be called "Audience" and may
    be renamed.
