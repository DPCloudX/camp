 * Make sure channel numbers pass through to events correctly.
 * Hook Control-C to avoid stuck notes (conductor.py)
 * Remove old comments
 * More Docstrings
 * More examples
 * Check that velocity works as expected
 * Check that durations work as expected
 * Roman class in band.member similar to scale reader
 * Simplify names of band.member classes
 * Architecture writeup / intro docs
 * Cleanup README
 * BETTER GENERATOR VS MIDDLEWARE SEPERATION <-- THIS NEXT!!
