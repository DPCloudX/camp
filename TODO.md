TODO List
=========

 * Hook Control-C to avoid stuck notes (conductor.py)
 * Remove old comments
 * More examples (examples folder)
 * Check that velocity works as expected
 * Check that durations work as expected
 * Better code sharing between subdivide.py and arp.py
 * More features for selector Randomly, as noted in examples/ file
 * Something like roman.py but called literal.py, that creates notes exactly by name - for use by drum synths - ignores scale
 * Implement the pattern router, which will make it easier to describe entire songs
 * Architecture writeup / intro docs
 * Go through all the member.*/selector.* code and make it more elegant using clever syntactic sugar and useful helper methods.
 * Cleanup README
