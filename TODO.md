TODO List
=========

High priority:
 * Hook Control-C to avoid stuck notes (conductor.py)
 * Make IAC port detection on OS X automatic so port number doesn't matter

Medium:
 * More examples (examples folder)
 * Check that velocity works as expected
 * Check that durations work as expected
 * Make velocity and duration sources
 * Make a Pattern Router that allows for choosing one of many patterns to fire, kind of the opposite of Ordered, which runs one, then the other.
 * Cleanup README
 * Start thinking about ways to express these configurations in non-code.

Low:
 * Remove old comments
 * Better code sharing between subdivide.py and arp.py
 * More features for selector Randomly, as noted in examples/ file
 * Architecture writeup / intro docs
 * Go through all the member.*/selector.* code and make it more elegant using clever syntactic sugar and useful helper methods.
